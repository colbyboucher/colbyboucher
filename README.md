# :skull_and_crossbones: Hey, Internet Stalker! :skull_and_crossbones:
## Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile, :black_heart:

I'm a student at Palm Beach State College, majoring in **computer science**. I have an **Associate of Science** degree in **computer programming** with additional certificates in **IoT**, **AI**, and **programming**. :coffin:

I'm a skateboarder, gamer, and guitarist, who likes to find ways to break systems and cause *mischeif*. :smiling_imp:

I'm always open to networking with other programmers, students, and professionals so connect/follow with me on **LinkedIn**:
[Click me if you're cool!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colbyboucher/)

I prefer to communicate through LinkedIn, so please don't email me unless it's important. :skateboard:
